    "### 1. Personal Dataset: Apple Health Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Files**: `export.xml` and `export_cda.xml`\n",
    "- **File Formats**: XML, CDA (Clinical Document Architecture)\n",
    "- **Rationale**: \n",
    "  - Apple Health data provides a highly personalized and detailed view of individual health and wellness, including data on metrics like steps, heart rate, and other health-related activities. This dataset is ideal for examining personal health trends over time, which is valuable for anyone interested in understanding how their physical activity, sleep, or other metrics change.\n",
    "  - The data structure includes `export.xml` for general health metrics and `export_cda.xml` in CDA format, which is widely recognized for structuring medical information. Including both files gives a more comprehensive view of health and activity data, allowing users to analyze both general and structured medical information in a standardized format.\n",
    "  - The choice of Apple Health data as the personal dataset reflects its utility in tracking health metrics, offering insights into how daily habits and health metrics evolve, and supporting ongoing personal health improvement efforts.\n",

    "### 2. Government Dataset: NICS Firearm Background Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source**: [GitHub - BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks)\n",
    "- **File Format**: CSV\n",
    "- **Files**: Monthly background check records\n",
    "- **Rationale**: \n",
    "  - The NICS Firearm Background Checks dataset provides a comprehensive view of monthly firearm background checks across U.S. states. This dataset is valuable for policy analysis and public safety research, as it helps in understanding trends related to firearm purchases and regulations.\n",
    "  - By examining this government data, researchers can explore how background checks have evolved over time and assess the potential impact of firearm policies across different regions. The dataset’s structure also allows for an analysis of regional and temporal trends, making it a robust resource for understanding public and governmental responses to firearm-related policies.\n",
    "  - Choosing this dataset emphasizes the role of government data in public policy and societal research, illustrating the importance of structured data in supporting policy assessments and public safety analysis.\n",
