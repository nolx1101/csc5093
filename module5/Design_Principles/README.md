# Design Principles: Space, Motion, Value, and Color

This folder contains the work for the 'Design Principles' assignment, which focuses on applying the principles of space, motion, value, and color to create meaningful visualizations using Python with data from the E-commerce dataset.

## Contents

### Python Visualizations
- **Notebook:** `Ecommerce_Visualizations.ipynb`
  - **yearly_revenue.png:** Line chart of yearly revenue trends, demonstrating:
    - **Motion:** Progression of years along the X-axis.
    - **Value:** Revenue represented on the Y-axis to highlight growth.
  - **delivery_time_distribution.png:** Histogram of delivery times, demonstrating:
    - **Space:** Properly spaced bins for clean distribution visualization.
    - **Value:** Frequency of deliveries quantified on the Y-axis.

## Data Source
- **File:** `order_items.xlsx`
  - Contains sales and delivery data from the E-commerce dataset.

## Tools
- **Python:** Used for creating visualizations with basic plotting techniques (e.g., Matplotlib).

## Purpose
This assignment demonstrates the application of design principles to create effective and aesthetically appealing visualizations that emphasize motion, space, value, and color.
