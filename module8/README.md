# Module 8 - Final Project: Border Crossing Analysis

## Overview
This module contains all the deliverables and files for the final project: **Border Crossing Analysis**. The project utilizes the **Border Crossing Entry Data** to analyze trends, regional differences, and transportation modes, presenting findings through interactive visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau.

## Deliverables

1. **Dataset**:  
   - File: `Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv`  
   - Description: A cleaned dataset containing monthly border crossing data by port, transportation mode, and border type (U.S.-Canada, U.S.-Mexico).

2. **Tableau Workbook**:  
   - File: `Border_Crossing_Analysis.twb`  
   - Description: Interactive Tableau visualizations, including:
     - Line chart: Temporal trends in border crossings.
     - Bar chart: Comparison of crossing types by border.
     - Geographic map: State-level activity.
     - Bubble chart: Distribution of crossing types.
     - Treemap: Ports by total crossing volume.

3. **Analysis Document**:  
   - File: `Border Crossing Entry Data Analysis.docx`  
   - Description: A detailed report covering data cleaning, exploratory and explanatory analysis, and findings with actionable implications.

4. **Presentation Slides**:  
   - File: `Border Crossing Analysis Presentation.pptx`  
   - Description: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project’s key insights and visualizations.

5. **Recorded Presentation**:  
   - File: `Border Crossing Analysis Video.mp4`  
   - Description: A video walkthrough of the project, presenting the findings and visualizations.

## Key Insights
- **Seasonal Trends**: Summer months exhibit peak border crossing activity.
- **Regional Differences**: Southern borders (e.g., Texas, California) show significantly higher traffic than northern borders.
- **Crossing Types**: Personal vehicle passengers and pedestrian crossings dominate the dataset, highlighting commuter traffic over commercial.

## Recommendations
- Optimize staffing and infrastructure at high-traffic ports during peak times.
- Prioritize investments in southern border ports such as El Paso and San Ysidro.
- Enhance collaboration with Canadian and Mexican authorities for better data coverage.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Dataset**: Open the `Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv` file to explore the cleaned dataset.
2. **Tableau Workbook**: Use Tableau to open `Border_Crossing_Analysis.twb` and interact with the visualizations.
3. **Analysis Document**: Refer to `Border Crossing Entry Data Analysis.docx` for a detailed explanation of the project.
4. **Presentation**: Review the slides in `Border Crossing Analysis Presentation.pptx` or watch the walkthrough in `Border Crossing Analysis Video.mp4`.
